# Employee-Churn-Prediction-with-Secure-Login

This project predicts whether an employee will leave the job or not depending on a series of questions answered by them. These answers are fed as input to the machine learning model which will then predict the most probable decision. We have seamlessly integrated simple yet effective user interface (front end) and our good accuracy logistic regression model using Flask. The website also displays and analyses the exploratory data analysis performed on the dataset to get further meaningful insights. In view of information cybersecurity, we have built a secure website using SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit), one of the most secure ways to protect digital information.

Tech Stack:

Frontend - HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Backend - Flask Framework(Python)


We have tried various models for prediction out of which Logistic Regression gave highest accuracy. 
Following table represents the models and their respective accuracies.
